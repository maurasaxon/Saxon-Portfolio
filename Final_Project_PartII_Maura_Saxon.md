# Final Project: Part II

# Wireframes
Below are two draft data visualizations representing the Maternal Mortality rates for Black and White women in Pennsylvania, as well as the percentage of women by race that do not encounter prenatal care during their first trimester. These two graphs are vital to the story. High Maternal Mortality rates impact all races, especially Black women. I think this significant statistic can be attributed to the lack of well-rounded prenatal care for Black women in Pennsylvania.

I need to add a graph that captures Maternal Mortality rates across the United States, but was unsure how to visualize this. Should I compare to other countries? Or compare all 50 states? Or both? In addition, I had trouble figuring out where to add specific information about Pittsburgh and Philly. I may end up just having the same graphs, but broken down more specifically (start with the U.S. stats, then PA stats, then Pittsburgh and Philly stats, but that may become boring/redundant). Furthermore, I need hard data to show how more prenatal visits in the first trimester lead to lower Maternal Mortality rates. I received critiques regarding the leap of faith that had to be made in my research story about how Maternal Mortality and prenatal visits are related. Most prenatal care data is related to outcomes about the baby (i.e. low birth weight), but I want to focus on the mother's health. 

# Storyboard
![Updated Storyboard part II](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54918227/66152621-d7120800-e5e7-11e9-90cc-8d9dd1b96841.jpg)
I want the reader to immediately understand the context of the issue. The introduction will show the Maternal Mortality rates across the United States. I then will focus in on Pennsylvania (Wireframe 1) because of the recent news article that was released about increase in Maternal Mortality rates for black women and Governor Wolf's plans to address this. Moreover, the problem should be clear: Black women have the highest Maternal Mortality rates compared to any other race. Next, I want to reader to connect the lack of prenatal/preventative care (Wireframe 2) to the high Maternal Mortality rates. In conclusion, the story should show that the best solution would be to give Black women better access to prenatal visits early on in their pregnancy. The way the reader can do this is by donating to WHAMGlobal (a donation link will be supplied at the end of the story). 

# User Research Protocol
I received eight user responses that helped me immensely. I created a Google Form that included Wireframes 1 and 2 and asked each review to describe their opinion of the graph and provide me any advice. I wanted to see if the message of the Wireframes were easy to understand and where there are holes in the story trying to be told. I sent the Google form to 5 of my Health Care Policy and Management classmates and 3 of my family members. The resuls are displayed in the image below.

These responses helped me understand what I need to improve upon particularly visually/aesthetically. If I could go back and rework the questions, I would ask more specifically what type of story they see this data telling. I think my target audience are people who are familiar with Public Health issues. More specifically, I think the target audience are people are feminists and passionate about women's health. White women are the clear demographic that would read this article; Black women already know that Maternal Mortality is a big problem in their community because they are the ones experiencing this. Half of the reviewers of my Wireframes were White women.

Next Steps: 
There are a few changes that I need to make to my data visualizations. There is an addition I need to make, though. I must add the correlation between prenatal visits and low maternal mortality. I know the data exists, but I cannot find it. So, for now I drew this

Moreover,I need to change the color scheme to something more consistent, as well as expand the data on Race (i.e. include more informatin on Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanics). 

# Moodboard
I want this story to exude Intersectional Feminism and Black female empowerment. I chose Millenial Pink as one of the main colors because it is a "trendy" color, but it also refers to the female gender. I chose to include the Black mother and child because this picture makes people feel love and warmth. In contrast, I have the protest picture from the Women's March. I think this juxtaposition of photos/feelings is perfect for this story because I want the reader to be enraged/frustrated by these statistics about minority mothers.

# Personas
The readers I expect to address with this final project are mainly women that consider themselves feminists. I expect women like myself to read this. I have a background in Public Health and am now studying Health Care Policy. I think well-educated women will find this topic interesting. Earlier, I mentioned White women will read this article because Black women probably already know what's happening in their community. But, that was more of a hope...I hope White women read this. White women are priveleged and we can use our privelege to help miniority women. I do not see men reading this article because they do not think they are directly impacted by women's health.
