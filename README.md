# Saxon-Portfolio
Portfolio of Graduate Student in Health Care Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University

# About Me
My name is Maura Saxon and I am in my final year of graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College where I am studying for a Master of Science in Health Care Policy and Management. This portfolio was created for the course entitled, "Telling Stories with Data." After graduation in Spring 2020, I plan on building a career in Health Care Consulting or Hospital Administration.

# What I Hope to Learn
I am hoping to learn hard-skills I can use for data visualization. In addition, I want to sharpen my Tableau skills. In my past internship experiences, I have always struggled with effectively visualizing my data analysis. After this course, I want to revisit my past projects and see how I could have created better and more impactful visualizations.
