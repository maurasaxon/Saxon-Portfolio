# Building My Solution
1. The Original

I chose this data visualization because it was from an article I enjoyed reading, but I knew the bar chart could be improved. I grew up watching Bob Ross's show, "The Joy of Painting." I felt that this data visualization did not fit with a description of Bob Ross's paintings. The bar chart was straightforward, but was not creative. I wanted to make a data visualization that got the same point across, but engaged the audience.

2. My Process
I critiqued the original data visualization using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. The original, entitled "The Paintings of Bob Ross," is useful, perceptive, truthful, and intuitive. The FiveThirtyEight article is geared towards fans of Bob Ross and his show "The Joy of Painting." The bar chart shows all of the painting attributes and how often they appeared in his paintings. The chart is useful and perceptive because the people reading this article are most likely reading it because they are already familiar with the show and want to learn about which scenes were painted the most. It is a very straightforward bar chart that is accurate and intuitive. 

The chart is not complete, nor is it aesthetically pleasing or engaging, though. The chart is not complete because it includes more information than needed; the author could have grouped some of the variables and reduced the length of the Y axis. Furthermore, the bar chart is not aesthetically pleasing. It has too many Y variables, but it is too simple in all other areas. After looking at the visualization, I do not think the audience is inspired to discuss the information further, which is disappointing because Bob Ross's paintings are so beautiful. This chart does not do Bob Ross's paintings justice. 

I would group the scene attributes (Y axis) to make it less busy. For example, there are units "at least one tree" and then "at least two trees," while also "coniferous tree" or "deciduous tree." There seems to be a lot of overlap with some of the units, so grouping them would decrease confounding variables. In addition, I would choose a different type of chart. A bar chart is a classic chart type, but I think this topic lends itself to something more creative. 

During the wireframing process, I tried to be as creative as possible without losing the integrity of the data. I sketched two drawings: one was a bar chart that included images of the actual scene unit. For example, if the scene type was "Tree," I drew a pine tree, and if the scene type was "Cloud", I drew a puffy cloud. This sketch confused the people I showed it to. The image associated with the scene type was not always straight forward and the percentage associated with each image was not as impactful as it was with the bar chart. My next sketch was based off of bubble charts, which I have been wanting to use as a data visualization for a while, but have never had the right variables. This sketch was better understood by my critics. The percentage of the associated scene type was still impactful and the color of bubbles kept the visualization creative.
