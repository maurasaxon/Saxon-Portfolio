# Maternal Mortality in Pennsylvania
Minority mothers in Pennsylvania face some of the worst disparities in obstetric care delivery.

# Outline
Labor and delivery is a scary thought to any new mother. White mothers encounter issues, but minority mothers are at an even greater risk of complications. I plan to show data portraying the risks of labor and delivery. The United States has the highest rates of maternal mortality among all other equally developed countries. Furthermore, I will break down maternal mortality rates in Pennsylvania, specifically Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

After my analysis and visusalization, I hope the reader understands how dangerous it is to give birth as a minority woman in the United States. There needs to be more emphasis on inclusive and preventative care that empowers minority mothers.

# Initial Sketches
My initial idea was to discuss how Pittsburgh is a hub for healthcare, but black mothers die in child-birth at an astounding rate. There was recently an article published about the high rates of maternal mortality in Pittsburgh, but I do not have access to their data, so I expanded the scope and will be looking at the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

# The Data
The following WESA article is the reason I chose this topic; Pittsburgh's maternal mortality rate is much higher for black women than in many other U.S. cities.

The following 3 links will take you to the data I plan on visualizing. A lot of the data is shown through bar and pie charts, but the importance of this dat is not being emphasized. For example, the maternal mortality rate of black women in PA is still well above the goal of 11.4 by 2020, but one chart shows the average of white wome and black women as emeting that goal. The goal of 11.4 maternal deaths per year is only met in PA because the rate for white women is so small, while the rate for black women is much higher.

# Method & Medium
I want the final product of this project to be either a petitions to sign or link to donate to WHAMGlobal. WHAMGlobal is the Women's Health Activist Movement and they partner with the Jewish Healthcare Foundation in Pittsburgh.

The petition coukd be addressed to the Governer of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf. The petition would be a call to action regarding maternal mortality rates among black women in PA. Furthermore, the petition could be in support of more funding to Pittsburgh's Gender Equity Commission, which is the entity that performed the study that discovered the high rates for black women.
